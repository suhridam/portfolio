## Projects
### Geographic variation and sexual differences in the complex duet song of Sarus Crane, a non-passerine waterbird

In my extensive study of Sarus Crane duets in the northern Indian floodplains, I aimed to uncover geographic variations in this unique animal acoustic communication. From September 2019 to March 2020, I diligently collected audio recordings of duets, analyzing them using Raven Pro audio analysis software and R statistical software.

To assess broad-scale duet properties, I employed spectrographic cross-correlation, dynamic time warping, and approximate string distance algorithms. For fine-scale properties, I conducted cluster analysis, used linear mixed-effect models, and applied discriminant analysis. Additionally, I utilized Generalized linear mixed-effect models to distinguish male and female notes in the duets.

My findings revealed seemingly random patterns in broad-scale duet properties, while fine-scale properties exhibited distinct trends correlating with geographic proximity and likely ecological influences. I also identified sex-specific distinctions in the notes, with geographic variations. As a result, I have prepared two manuscripts, currently under review for imminent publication. This research provides valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of Sarus Crane communication in this region and forms the basis of my doctoral thesis.

### Decoding triet singing behaviour in Sarus Crane, a unique vocal collaboration between three individuals
[Publication](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3707)

This study on Sarus Crane communication in tropical and subtropical regions focuses on triets, a coordinated vocalization involving three individuals. This research, part of a multi-year project in three Indian states, used field observations and acoustic measurements to distinguish between duets and triets.

Using RavenPro software and the WarbleR R-package, I obtained Sarus Crane duets and triets measurements which were again utlized in Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Kruskal-Wallis tests. I also measured calling pattern similarity between singers using the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) and used conditional probability to understand the effects of male and female notes on other participants.

The findings revealed that Sarus Crane triets involve an adult breeding pair leading the duet, with a third individual joining and following closely. Triets had lower frequencies than duets, suggesting a helper role in territory defense. The leading pair showed more singing pattern similarities than the third individual, indicating that young cranes may join pairs to learn duets. This research offers rare insights into Sarus Crane communication systems and forms the basis for further investigation.

### Understanding different ecological factors that can shape duet properties in non-passerine Sarus Crane

In my extensive study, I explored Sarus Crane duet property variations, considering ecological factors like territory quality, chick presence/absence, and Sentinel satellite imagery for land cover data. I obtained high-resolution imagery from Google Earth Engine (10m spatial resolution, 5% cloud cover) between December 2021 and February 2022, processed using the median reducer operator. Classification employed NDVI, NDWI, and NDMI indices alongside multispectral imagery to identify land categories (e.g., Vegetation, Cropland, Fallow Land, Built-up, Wetland, and Waterbody). Linear regression analyses compared land use proportions and ecological measurements with Sarus Crane duet properties, assessed using Raven Pro and R software. Results will be published in an upcoming journal manuscript, currently in preparation.

### Patterns of spatial and temporal interactions in a sympatric wildlife assemblage of the Indian trans-Himalaya (Completed)

This study in the Indian Trans-Himalaya's Spiti Valley aimed to understand competition and predation dynamics among sympatric mammal and bird species through camera trapping at 57 sites for 3 years. Results revealed Snow leopards and red foxes exhibited temporal and spatial overlap. Large livestock shared temporal activity with blue sheep and ibex but had distinct spatial patterns. Red foxes showed generalist behaviour. Stone marten and woolly hare exhibited nocturnal patterns with high temporal overlap. Royle's pika had restricted space and time use. Stone marten may be benefiting from higher temporal overlap with the prey woolly hare and seems to be co-existing with the larger predator red fox. Temporal activity patterns of different species seem to be driven by a trade-off between consuming prey and avoidance of larger predators.
